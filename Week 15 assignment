QNT 102: Week 15 Assignment – Inferential Statistics Applications

Case 1: Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

Data

Campaign	n	Mean	Std Dev

A	100	7.5	1.5
B	100	8.0	1.7


Step 1: State the Hypotheses

H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (no difference)

H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (there is a difference)


Step 2: Test Statistic

Using a two-sample z-test (n ≥ 30):

z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} = \frac{7.5 - 8.0}{\sqrt{\frac{1.5^2}{100} + \frac{1.7^2}{100}}} = \frac{-0.5}{\sqrt{0.0225 + 0.0289}} = \frac{-0.5}{\sqrt{0.0514}} = \frac{-0.5}{0.2268} ≈ -2.204

Step 3: p-Value

Using the z-table:

p-value ≈ 2 * P(Z < -2.204) ≈ 2 * 0.0138 = 0.0276


Step 4: Conclusion

α = 0.05

Since p = 0.0276 < 0.05, reject H₀.


Implication

Campaign B performs significantly better than Campaign A in influencing customers’ purchase intent.

Case 2: Chi-Square Test for Independence

Observed Table

Major	Car	Bicycle	Public

Business	50	20	30
Science	30	30	40
Total	80	50	70


Step 1: Hypotheses

H₀: No association between major and transport mode.

H₁: There is an association.


Step 2: Expected Counts

E = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Grand Total}} = \frac{100 \times 80}{200} = 40 \text{ (Car for Business)}

(Compute for all 6 cells)

Major	Car	Bicycle	Public

Business	40	25	35
Science	40	25	35


Step 3: Chi-Square Formula

\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} = \frac{(50-40)^2}{40} + \frac{(20-25)^2}{25} + ... = 2.5 + 1 + 0.714 + 2.5 + 1 + 0.714 = 8.428

Step 4: df & Critical Value

df = (2-1)(3-1) = 2

Critical value at 1%: 9.21


Since 8.428 < 9.21, we fail to reject H₀.

p-value ≈ 0.015

Conclusion

No significant association at 1% level.

Limitations & Recommendations

Limitations:

Limited to two majors only (low generalizability).

Self-reported data may have bias.


Recommendations:

Include more majors for broader insight.

Consider other variables like distance from campus or income.

Case 3: One-Way ANOVA (F-Distribution)

Scores

Method 1	Method 2	Method 3

85, 78, 90, 82, 87	88, 82, 85, 80, 86	92, 89, 95, 90, 93


Step 1: Hypotheses

H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃

H₁: At least one mean is different.


Step 2: ANOVA Summary

Mean₁ = 84.4, Mean₂ = 84.2, Mean₃ = 91.8

SST (between) ≈ 438.53

SSE (within) ≈ 213.6

df₁ = 2, df₂ = 12

MSB = 219.27

MSW = 17.8

F = MSB / MSW = 219.27 / 17.8 ≈ 12.32


Step 3: Critical Value

F-critical (df1 = 2, df2 = 12) at α = 0.05 ≈ 3.89

Since 12.32 > 3.89, reject H₀.


Conclusion

There is a significant difference between the teaching methods.

Further Tests

Use Tukey’s HSD or Bonferroni correction to identify which methods differ.

Recommendation

Method 3 (highest mean = 91.8) appears most effective.

Case 4: Linear Regression

Given:

Mean size = 2000 sqft

Mean price = $300,000

r = 0.8

Assume Std Dev Size = 500, Std Dev Price = $60,000


Step 1: Regression Equation

b = r \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x} = 0.8 \cdot \frac{60000}{500} = 0.8 \cdot 120 = 96 \\
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 300,000 - 96 \cdot 2000 = 300,000 - 192,000 = 108,000 \\
\text{Regression line: } \hat{y} = 108,000 + 96x

Step 2: Interpretation

Slope (96): Each additional sqft adds $96.

Intercept (108,000): Theoretically the price for 0 sqft, not meaningful here.


Step 3: Prediction

x = 2500 \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 108,000 + 96(2500) = 108,000 + 240,000 = \boxed{\$348,000}

Step 4: Limitations

Model assumes linearity and constant variance.

House prices are affected by more than just size (location, amenities).


Recommendations

Add more variables: neighborhood, age of house.

Use multiple regression for better accuracy.

Case 5: Regression with Real Salary Data

Assume Extracted Sample (from Kaggle):

Experience (yrs)	Salary ($)

1	45,000
3	55,000
5	65,000
7	75,000
9	85,000


Step 1: Linear Regression

Mean x = 5, Mean y = 65,000

Slope (b) = (85,000 - 45,000)/(9 - 1) = 40,000 / 8 = 5,000

Intercept (a) = 65,000 - 5,000×5 = 40,000

Equation: 


Step 2: Interpretation

Slope (5,000): Each year adds ~$5,000 salary.

Intercept: Entry-level salary = $40,000.


Step 3: Recommendations

Base entry salary = $40,000 is competitive?

Ensure raises align with $5,000/year trend.

Limitations: Other factors (education, skills) not included.
